REST-Framework

To run the project please install Live-Server extension or similar. Right click on index.html and select 'Open with Live Server'. That approach fixes a  files fetch api bug on Chrome.
 I was using VS Code with Live Server while developing.




**********************************************
Future improvements when apps is grown:

- bundling, minification files (e.g. webpack) - better performance
- being more modular e.g. creating components with React or other librbary
- improve structure e.g. creating subfolders with new features components, new routes for subpages


*********************************************
Fixes for next release:)

- find solution for dynamic content highliting issue
- using different api than fetch so that xml can be completely displayed
- re-organise layout for better mobile devices experience (I added couple of media queries so page looks fine on smaller screens)
